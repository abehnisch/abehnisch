        <h1>Do Tactics Matter?</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p>❝<strong>Tactics talk is everywhere in football. We just assume that it matters. Journalists and bloggers write intricate pieces about tactics, even television pundits dip their toes into tactical waters, fans argue over back threes and false nines, coaches acquire cult status based on tactical reputations, beer-bellied kickers in the park worry about keeping their shape (on the pitch) and good hours go to waste in front of computer screens searching for the perfect formation in <i>Football Manager</i>. But how do we know that tactics make a difference? Just because we believe it does not make it true. Consider all the God talk in sport. When fans and players pray for supernatural help, I am quite sure that God does not make a difference to whether my Arsenal is winning or losing. Is believing in tactics real or another football faith?</strong>❞</p>
